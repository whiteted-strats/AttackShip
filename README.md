Attack Ship 2:06 Analysis

This repository details the entire approach used to model the mathematics behind the ending of Perfect Dark's Attack Ship stage (https://rankings.the-elite.net/perfect-dark/stage/attack-ship). In particular we consider how lucky Chuya Takizawa's 2:06 run was.

We arrive at a probability of just 1 in 119 of doing atleast as well in the ending as in the 2:06 run.

The repository contains the following files:
- AttackShip.pdf : The main report, read or atleast refer to this to understand the code.
- Program.cs : The main C# program, which can be copied into a console application in visual studio community.
- DistinctQueue.cs : A little class needed by the main program.
- data_csv.csv : The cumulative distribution outputted by the main program.

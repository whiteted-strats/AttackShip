Attack Ship 2:06 Analysis

This contains a pdf detailing the approach used to model the mathematics behind the ending of Perfect Dark's Attack Ship stage (https://rankings.the-elite.net/perfect-dark/stage/attack-ship). In particular we consider how lucky Chuya Takizawa's 2:06 run was.

This repository also contains the main Python script which was used to compute the probabilities. The other two scripts are a simulator, showing that my theory stands up to reality, and a simpler script which does not model the "timeout" feature of the enemies' spawns. These are discussed in the pdf.

We arrive at a probability of doing atleast as well in the ending of 1 in 1037.
